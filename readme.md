# Codes and demo for ICASSP 2022 submission. 

This repo includes two models: a harmonization model and a melody generation model. Both models apply adversarial intervention to disentangle representation from sequential conditions to gain better control. Due to limited space, we only present the harmonization model in the paper. Our paper is under single-blind review at the moment.
