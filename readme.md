# Domain Adversarial Training on Conditional VAE. 
Paper: [Domain Adversarial Training on Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder for Controllable Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07144)

This is a follow-up work of [EC2-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03626), aiming at better conditional control.

Training and validation data is now available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qi6qVuZvH5sskv0ePyTKldjE8IbvACUc/view?usp=sharing) (~2GB). This file contains ~2K processed lead sheets (melody + chord) collected from [Nottingham](https://ifdo.ca/~seymour/nottingham/nottingham.html) and [POP909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07142).
